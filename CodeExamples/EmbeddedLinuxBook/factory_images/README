This folder contains a number of files that are loaded into NAND flash
on the Mini2440 along with tools to reload these files if necessary.

Scripts -- Read these files to understand how they work
  mk_kernel.sh -- Convert a kernel executable image into a u-boot image
                  by invoking mkimage
  mk_uboot.sh  -- Convert a text file into a u-boot script by invoking
                  mkimage.  (Note that the book erroneously refers to this
                  as mk_uboot)
  move_files.sh-- Move the kernel, uboot, and root file system images to
                  the default TFTP directory
  mini_boot    -- A u-boot script to initialize NAND flash and load u-boot,
                  the kernel, and the root file system into NAND (plain
                  text version)
  set-mini_boot-- A minicom script for invoking mini_boot.scr

Remember to preface the shell script name with ./ if you execute it from
factory_images/.
