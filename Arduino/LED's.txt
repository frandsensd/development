Typical LED's (5mm)
===================
Polarity:
+	long leg (anode)
-	short leg (cathode)
Voltage: 2.1V
Max current: 20mA

Serial resistor recommendation
5V DC
Brightest light:
(5-2.1)/20m [V/A] = 145 Ohm. 
Hence to avoid breaking the LED the serial resistor MUST be greater than 145 Ohm.
Typical examples:
220 Ohm => (5-2.1)/220 [V/Ohm] = 13.2 [mA] => Bright light
1k Ohm  => (5-2.1)/1k  [V/Ohm] =  2.9 [mA] => Little dimmer light
10k Ohm => (5-2.1)/10k [V/Ohm] = 0.29 [mA] => Weak light



RGB LED's
=========
Polarity:
+	Shortest three, with 
	RED at flat side,
	GREEN after cathode,
	BLUE after GREEN
-	Cathode, second from flat side.
Same configuration as LED's above, but contains three individually controlled LED's.
Using PWM the intensity of the RGB can be controlled on the three inputs, allowing
any color to be displayed.
