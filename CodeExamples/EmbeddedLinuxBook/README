                          Sample Software


  This folder contains the software you will need to carry out the exercises
  in the book.

  /
    mkimage - utility to add a 64-byte u-boot header to a file. Install in
              /usr/local/arm/4.3.2/bin
    yaffs.patch - patch file to be applied to the linux-3.1.5 from kernel.org.
              This includes the yaffs file system, device drivers for the adc,
              buttons, and leds, plus a change to the lcd selection code.

  factory_images/
    See the README file for descriptions of the files in this folder

  home/
    Sample code and header files for application development on the target
    board.  Copy this to the home folder in your target file system, root_qtopia/.

  record_sort/
    Sample code for the exercise in Chapter 6, Eclipse.

  NOTES
    1.  The numbers that desribe the Mini2440 lcd type have changed.  The default is
        now 3.
            0 - All 3.5 inch portrait oriented panels; N35, T35, and X35.
            1 - 7 inch panels, A70.
            2 - VGA
            3 - 3.5 inch landscape panel, W35.

    2.  The backlight boots up off so you won't see the screen.  To turn it on
        execute this command:
            echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/backlight/brightness

    3.  LED1 blinks, apparently driven by some sort of watchdog that I haven't
        been able to identify.

    4.  Chapter 9 mentions the device drivers for the Mini2440 peripherals and
        says they are in linux/drivers/char.  That won't be true until Chapter
        11.  Either skip ahead or wait until then to look at the drivers.
